  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction: A Wordy and Redundant Overview</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-700">
    Welcome, valued user, to our website, a digital portal designed to provide you with a plethora
    of information, engaging content, and potentially, in the future, opportunities to purchase
    goods and/or services. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us, ranking highly amongst
    our corporate values and guiding principles. Therefore, we have painstakingly crafted this
    comprehensive and exhaustive Privacy Policy to delineate, explain, and thoroughly articulate
    the ways in which we collect, utilize, disseminate, protect, and otherwise manage your
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as well as non-personally identifiable information
    (Non-PII) which may, in some circumstances, be linked directly or indirectly to you. We implore
    you, the user, to read this document in its entirety, and to revisit it periodically, as it
    may be subject to change from time to time, without any prior notice, or with prior notice,
    depending on our mood and the prevailing winds. This policy applies to all aspects of our
    website and online operations, past, present, and future, to the fullest extent permissible
    by applicable law.

    <li>
      <h3 className="font-semibold">Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        We automatically collect certain information about your device, your browsing habits, and
        your interactions with our website. This information is collected through the use of
        cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, server logs, and other tracking technologies that may or
        may not be fully disclosed herein. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to: your
        IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your referring website, your exit
        pages, the date and time of your visit, the pages you viewed, the links you clicked, your

        enhancement, and general data collection.

    <li>
      <h3 className="font-semibold">Information from Third Parties:</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        We may also receive information about you from third-party sources, such as social media
        platforms, data brokers, advertising networks, and other entities that have access to your
        personal information. This information may include, but is not necessarily limited to:
        your demographic information, your interests, your online behavior, your purchasing history,
        and any other information that these third parties have collected about you through their
        own means and methods. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third
        parties, and we encourage you to review their respective privacy policies for more
        information. We reserve the right to combine this information with the information we
        collect directly from you, thereby creating a more comprehensive and detailed profile of
        your online activities and preferences.

      <h3 className="font-semibold">Cookies and Tracking Technologies: A Repetitive and Redundant Explanation</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        We employ a variety of cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies to
        collect information about your browsing behavior on our website. Cookies are small text
        files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Web beacons are small graphic
        images that are embedded in web pages and emails. Pixel tags are similar to web beacons and
        are used to track user activity. These technologies allow us to track your movements on our
        website, to remember your preferences, and to personalize your experience. We use both
        session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which
        remain on your device for a longer period of time). You can disable cookies in your browser
        settings, but this may affect your ability to use certain features of our website. By using
        our website, you consent to our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, whether you
        understand what that means or not. We may also use third-party cookies for advertising and
        analytics purposes. These cookies are subject to the privacy policies of the third parties
        that provide them. We make no guarantees about the security or privacy of these third-party
        cookies.
